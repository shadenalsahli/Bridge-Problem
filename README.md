# Bridge Problem

A group of K persons (K > 1) want to cross a bridge from East to West during the night. The time needed by each person to cross the bridge is unique. The persons that are crossing the bridge must use a flashlight. There is only one flashlight. The bridge is very narrow and allows two persons maximum to cross it at the same time. Two persons go from east to west and one person returns with the flashlight from west to east. If the two persons are crossing the bridge together, they are crossing it at the speed of the slower one. These people are trying to cross the bridge as quickly as possible.
I solved this problem using two strategies (Uniform Cost Search and A*), to find the optimal solution for these persons to cross the bridge in the minimum time.
